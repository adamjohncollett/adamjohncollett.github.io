									<h1> - - My current focus - - </h1> 
									<h2><a >  Coding / CFA / new  oppurtunities</a> <h2>
									
								</header>
								<p> I recently left my strategy consulting job (April 2020) to pursue my passions for coding and finance full time. After alot of life contemplation and time thinking about which parts of my career I have enjoyed the most, the one thing that always stuck out was coding. When working at The Directline Group I would
								spend hours after work improving my pricing algorithmn just for the pure problem solving enjoyment it gave me. Combining this with my deeply enjoyed time focusing on asset risk and 
								portfolio analysis at The Channel Syndicate (now SCOR UK). I thought it was time to change my mindset and pursue my passions and interests in pursuit of true fulfilment, not to just focus on the rat race. 
								
								<h3><a >Short term objectives:</a></h3>
								<ul>
									<li> Pursue coding focused financial positions - (fixed income , hedging, ALM, quant roles)</li>
									<li> Intensely focus on enhancing my python skills until I can carry out current industry leading financial analysis techniques - aim to upload regular projects of my work to showcase ability</li>
									<li> Study for CFA level 2 which I am registered for in Decemeber  </li>
								</ul>
								<h3><a >Medium term objective:</a></h3>
								<ul>
									<li> Once very comfortable with python, look to pick up C++ to understand compiling vs scripting</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Coding.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h3><a >Coding - Python </a><br /></h3>
								<h5> Python experience and focus <br /></h5>
								<p> Complex analysis workflows and visualisation. Database manipulation, API interaction, machine learning workflows. Back testing and implementation of ML trading algorithms with risk management metrics. Monte Carlo simulation of derivatives through object orientated programming created in financial environments <br>

								My current focus thus far has been to get up speed with all python functionality I believed would be relevant to a financial position and then to focus more heavily on finance specific topics:  Monte carlo simulation, derivatives and financial analysis and algorithmic trading with Machine learning strategies
								</p>
								<h5> Books and resources covered so far<br /></h5>
								<ul>
									<li> over > 150 hours of structured learning with DataCamp, finishing Datacamps DataCamp Python for DataScience and Python Programmar courses as well as other focused topics</li>
									<li> Powerful Object Orientated Coding in Python - Programming Python - O Reilly </li>
									<li> Fluent Python - O Reilly (still underway)</li>
									<li> Python for Finance - O Reilly</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h5> Future books to be covered <br /></h5>		
								<ul>	
									<li> Advanced Algorithmic Trading Strategies - QuantNet </li>  						
								</ul>
								<h3><a >Coding - SAS and other languages </a><br /></h3>
								<ul>
									<li> SAS - Ownership and development of an insurance pricing algorithm with 40+ pricing factors. Relational database queries, renewal and pricing alogritmn logic writing with General linear modelling factor maintenance and implementation.</li>
									<li> VBA - Used adhoc throughout career, recording and manipulating macros, web/data scraping</li>
									<li> HTML - Creating this website and webscraping through python </li>
								</ul>
								<h3><a>  Proffesional Qualifications - Actuarial  </a> </h3>
								<p>  I passed 5 of the 8 Core technical actuarial exams: ct1, ct2, ct3, ct7 and ct8 covering , having really enjoyed the investment and economics modules I didn't want to move away from that and into more longevity actuarial focused subjects. I therefore 
									 decided to pursue the CFA exams instead, I am currently studying towards level 2  </p>

								<h3><a>  Proffesional Qualifications - CFA  </a> </h3>

								<p>  Having really enjoyed the investment and economics modules I didn't want to move away from that and into more longevity actuarial focused subjects. I therefore 
									 decided to pursue the CFA exams instead. I have passed level 1 and I am currently studying towards level 2 in Decemeber as unfortunately my plans to sit this June 
									 were disrupted with covid 19.
