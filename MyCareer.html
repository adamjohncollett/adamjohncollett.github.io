									<h1>The skills I've developed thus far <br />

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Coding.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h3><a >Coding in Python, SAS and others </a><br /></h3>
								<h5> Why Physics? <br /></h5>
								<p>	I chose to do Physics at university as I have always had a strength in maths but loved understanding physical problems and phenomena as opposed to abstract concepts. 
								I extended my time to gain a Masters as I always enjoyed the research element through out the course and wanted to sharpen my analytical capability to the next level.  <br /></p>
								<h5><a > Key Commerical Skills Gained? </a><br /></h5>
								
								<p>	
								<ul>
									<li>The complexitiy of my degree and my mulitple in-depth research projects have engrained in me a logical approach to problem solving and how I interpret the world.</li>
									
									<li>    It has built my strong foundations in hypothesis derivation and testing - allowing me to make swift predictions of problem causes and to iterate efficiently to finding solutions </li>
									<li>    I was also exposed to python and monte carlo simulation for the first time setting me along the path of coding enthusiasim  </li>

								<h3><a> Actuarial - Pricing </a><br /></h3>	
								<h5> Why Actuarial? <br /></h5>
								<p>	I started my career in the actuarial space as I believed the heavy analytical skills required would play to my strengths and my outgoing personality would assist in explaining complex matters to varied stakeholders in an understandable manner, hopefully providing me an edge. <br /></p>	
								<h5><a>Key Commercial Skills Gained?</a><br /></h5>
								<p>	
								<ul>
									<li>I worked on several personal and commerical lines products across the direct, broker and aggregator channels. This has given me a solid understanding of the different distribution dynamics within the non-speciality insurance market and the enocomics within those channels.</li>
									<li>I learned to code proficiently in SAS taking complete control of the NIG Van pricing algorithmn within 3 months. I carried out complex database queries on a daily basis and that set the concrete base for my algorithmic today in which i continue to develop.</li>
									<li>More commercailly, I learned everything to do with technical pricing and pricing stratgies: new business and propensity, the oppurtunities from customer elasticity, discount initiatives and algorithmn strategies available through broker platforms. I also learned how loss ratios develop and the different characterisitcs of less speciality products lines</li>
									<li> I also regular pitched my own pricing intiaitives to the pricing commitee keeping my presentational skills honed and my analytical skills balanced</li>
								</ul>	
								<h3><a>  Actuarial - Capital </a><br /></h3>
								<h5> Why the move to capital?<br /></h5>
								<p>I moved to capital as I wanted to gain a more commerical understanding of how an insurance business operates as a whole, not just the intricacies of a single product	</p>	
								<h5><a>Key Commercial skills Gained?</a><br /></h5>
								<p>
								<ul>
									<li>I developed a solid understanding of monte carlo simulation aka stochastic modeling, gaining exposure to all areas of risk modelling within an insurance business: loss modelling, market/ investment risk, operational risk, reinsurance and catastrophe risk.</li>
									<li>I contributed to the parameterisation of each risk category and was also very involved with the business plan forecasting and the corresponding correlation considerations for both -  a strong background in risk management and the awareness of correlations is key across all commercial businesses.</li>
									<li>I learned the details of variables effecting regulatory capital requirement and its relationship to share price, rare knowledge.</li>
									<li>I got to understand the running of an insurance business at the portfolio level, how the risk reward characterisitcs of indiviudal products pool together and the levers management can utilise to enhance ROE and mitigate downside risk such as product diversification benefits and reinsurance structures.</li>
									<li>Modelling of reinsurance structures, as hedging strategies to decrease cashflow volatility and allow for more predicitive business planning has provided me with a base for more investment focussed derivatives strategies.

									<li>I also pushed to build out the businesses market risk analysis capabilities, creating quarterly FX, Interest Rate and Bond Return exhibits in Tableau: including fan chart forecasts and probabilistic expecations.	I utilised the bond return projections to create portfolio performance probabilisitc forecasting and to carry out asset allocation and efficient frontier analyis, presenting to management ideas to improve bottom line performance.</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/consulting.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h3><a> Strategy Consulting (Insurance and Wealth Management) </a></h3>
								<h5>Why the move away from Actuarial? </h5>
								<p> Working for a small syndicate with more traditional managment, I believed there was a wealth of analytics, whether out of the capital model, the actuarial team or from my own asset allocation tool creations that could have been being leveraged far more to enform director decision making but wasn't.<br /> 
									I therefore decided to be able to be more impactful I would need to get more access to senior employees. This, combined with my growing interest in finance pushed me to move into a strategy consulting role in the life insurance/ asset and wealth management space.
								<h5><a>Key Commercial skills Gained?</a><br /></h5>	
								<p>
								<ul>
									<li>I got to contribute to many market sizing, market entry and distribution strategy projects: consistently considering factors such as: how large is the market under consideration, is it growing, is there differentiation in customer characteristics, can the market be segmented,
									how heavily is it contested, who are the biggest competitors and how integrated are their supply chains, what level of economics are they able to achieve, and much more.</li>
									<li>All key aspects and considerations for running a business or deploying new products that one would not get exposure to in an actuarial function. This experience I beleive has really balanced out my analytic capability to make me an all round commerical asset.</li>
									<li>I also got the oppurtunity to project management large insights research projects and interview a considerable amount of key decision makers, in the UK and abroad, across life insurers, wealth managers and intermediaries for both group B2B and B2C business across insurance/reinsurance and wealth managent topics. 
										This has provided me with a great perspective in customer psychology and understanding of what drives customer behaviour in B2B and B2C business.</li>
								</ul>
									
									
								<h3><a>  Proffesional Qualificaitons - Actuarial and CFA </a> </h3>
								<p>  I passed 5 of the 8 Core technical actuarial exams however, having really enjoyed the investment and economics modules I didn't want to move away from that and into more longevity actuarial focused subjects. I therefore 
									 decided to pursue the CFA exams instead, I am currently studying towards level 2  </p>
