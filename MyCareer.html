									<h1>The skills I've developed thus far <br />
										</h1>
									
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/main pic3.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h3><a >Masters Degree in Physics </a><br /></h3>
								<h5> Why Physics? <br /></h5>
								<p>	I chose to do Physics at university as I have always had a strength in maths but loved understanding physical problems and phenomena.<br /></p>
								<h5><a > Key Commerical Skills Gained? </a><br /></h5>
								
								<p>	The complexitiy of my degree and my latter year research has engrained in me a logical approach to problem solving and how I interpret the world.<br />
									
									     It has built my strong foundations in hypothesis derivation and testing - allowing me to make swift predictions of problem causes and iterate efficeintly to high a solution </p>
								
								<h3><a> Actuarial - Pricing </a><br /></h3>	
								<h5> Why Actuarial? <br /></h5>
								<p>	I started my career in the actuarial space as I believed the heavy analytics would play to my strengths and my outgoing personality could assist in explaining complex matters to stake holders <br /></p>	
								<h5><a>Key Commercial Skills Gained?</a><br /></h5>
								<p>	I worked on several personal and commerical lines products across the direct, broker and aggregator channels, this has given me a solid understanding of the different distribution dynamics and the enocomics within those channels.<br />
									I learned to code proficiently in SAS taking complete control of the NIG Van pricing algorithmn within 3 months. I carried out complex database queries on a daily basis, this set a concreate base for the algorithmic thinking I contine to develop today.<br /> 
									More commercailly, I learned everything to do with technical pricing and pricing stratgies: new business and propensity, the oppurtunities from elasticity, discount initiatives and algorithmn strategies available through platforms. I also learned how loss ratios develop and the different characterisitcs of less speciality products.</p>
									
								<h3><a>  Actuarial - Capital </a><br /></h3>
								<h5> Why the move to capital?<br /></h5>
								<p>I moved to capital as I wanted to gain a more commerical understanding of how an insurance busines operates as a whole, not just the intricacies of a single product	</p>	
								<h5><a>Key Commercial skills Gained?</a><br /></h5>
								<p> I gained a solid understanding of monte carlo simulation aka stochastic modeling, gaining exposure to all areas of risk modelling within an insurance business: Loss modelling, market/ investment risk, operational risk and cat risk.<br />
									I contributed to the paramterisaiton and forecasting involved in each risk and the copula and correlation matricies implemented to combined them altogether -  a strong background in risk management and the awareness of correlations is key across all commercial businesses.<br />
									I learned the details of variables effecting regulatory capital requirement and its relationship to share price, rare knowledge.<br />
									I got to understand the running of an insurance business at the portfolio level, how the risk reward characterisitcs of indiviudal products pool together and the levers management can utilise to enhance ROE such as product diversification benefits and reinsurance structures.<br />

									I also pushed to build out the businesses market risk analysis capabilities, creating quarterly FX, Interest Rate and Bond return exhibits: including fan chart forecasts and probabilistic expecations.<br />
									I utilised the bond return projections to create portfolio performance projections and carry out asset allocation and efficient frontier analyis, presenting to management ideas to improve bottom line performance.

								<h3><a> Strategy Consulting (Insurance and Wealth Management) </a></h3>
								<h5>Why the move away from Actuarial? </h5>
								<p> Working for a small syndicate with more traditional managment, I believed there was a wealth of analytics, whether out of the capital model, the actuarial team or from my own asset allocation tool creations that could have been being leveraged far more to enform director decision making but wasn't.<br /> 
									I therefore decided to be able to be more impactful I would need to get more access to senior employees. This, combined with my growing interest in finance pushed me to move into a strategy consuklting role.
								<h5><a>Key Commercial skills Gained?</a><br /></h5>	
								<p>I got to contribute to many market sizing, market entry and dsitribution strategy projects: consistently considering factors such as: how large is the market under consideration, is it growing, is there differentiation in customer characteristics, can the market be segemented,
									how heavily is it contested, who are the biggest competitors and how integrated are their supply chain, what level of economics can they able to achieve, and much more.<br />
									All key aspects and considerations for running a business or deploying new products that one would not get exposure to in an actuarial function. This experience I beleive has really balanced out my analytic capability to make me an allround commerical asset.<br />
									I also got the oppurtunity to project management large insights research projects and interview a considerable amount of key decision, in the UK and abroad, across life insurers and intermediaries, this has provided me with a great perspective in customer psychology and understanding what drives customer behaviour in B2B business.<br /></p>

									
									
								<h3><a>  Proffesional Qualificaitons - Actuarial and CFA </a> </h3>
								<p>  I passed 5 of the 8 Core technical actuarial exams however, having really enjoyed the investment and economics modules I didn't want to move away from that and into more longevity actuarial focused subjects. I therefore 
									 decided to pursue the CFA exams instead, I am currently studying towards level 2  </p>
